## Reasoning Chain

The complete reasoning trace showing prompt→response progression with cryptographic hash chaining. 
Each node represents a verified reasoning step, color-coded by guard status:

- **Blue**: Prompt
- **Green**: Safe response (all guards passed)
- **Yellow**: Caution (some metrics in warning zone)
- **Red**: Alert (potential hallucination detected)

*Each edge is labeled with the SHA-256 hash prefix linking steps cryptographically.*

## Hash Propagation Proof

Cryptographic hash chain showing parent→child relationships. 
This demonstrates tamper-evidence: any modification to a step would break the chain.

- **Teal nodes**: Regular step certificates
- **Red nodes**: Master certificates (aggregation points)
- **Arrows**: Parent hash → Chain hash links

## Hallucination Guard Trace

Temporal visualization of hallucination detection metrics across all reasoning steps. 
Four independent metrics provide multi-faceted detection:

1. **Semantic Similarity** (blue solid): Measures prompt-response alignment
2. **Entropy Change** (orange dashed): Detects information drift/injection
3. **Logical Consistency** (green dotted): Validates reasoning coherence
4. **Token Overlap** (purple dash-dot): Verifies response grounding

### Thresholds

- **Green Zone**: ≥ 0.75 (safe)
- **Yellow Zone**: 0.50 - 0.74 (caution)
- **Red Zone**: < 0.50 (alert)

### 🚨 Hallucination Alerts

The following steps triggered hallucination guards:

| Step | Prompt | Triggered Guards |
|------|--------|------------------|
| 2 | What is 5+3? | token_overlap_red |
| 3 | Multiply your previous answer by 2. | semantic_similarity_red, entropy_change_red, logical_consistency_yellow, token_overlap_red |
| 4 | What is the final result? | semantic_similarity_red, logical_consistency_yellow, token_overlap_red |
| 5 | What is 2+2? | semantic_similarity_red, token_overlap_red |

**Total**: 4 step(s) flagged as potential hallucinations

## Certificate Hierarchy

Hierarchical aggregation showing how step certificates roll up into master certificates and session manifests. 
This structure enables efficient verification of large reasoning traces.

![Master Certificate Tree](../figures/master_certificate_tree.svg)

- **Top**: Session manifest (aggregates all proofs)
- **Middle**: Master certificates (aggregate multiple steps)
- **Bottom**: Individual step certificates (leaf nodes)

## Verification Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ VERIFIED

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Hash Correspondence | ✅ PASS |
| Node Count Match | ✅ PASS |
| Chain Integrity | ✅ PASS |
| Guard Status Accuracy | ✅ PASS |
| Determinism Verification | ✅ PASS |
